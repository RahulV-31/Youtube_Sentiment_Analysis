# YouTube Comments Sentiment & Engagement Analysis

Welcome to the **YouTube Comments Sentiment & Engagement Analysis** project ‚Äî a comprehensive Python pipeline that extracts, analyzes, and visualizes YouTube video comments to provide actionable insights into viewer sentiment and engagement dynamics.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This tool leverages the YouTube Data API to fetch comments from any public video and combines advanced natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and emoji parsing to paint a vivid picture of audience reactions. Beyond simple counts, it calculates a **custom engagement score** that balances quantitative metrics (likes, views, subscribers) with qualitative insights (sentiment polarity, emoji sentiment, comment length) ‚Äî a holistic metric designed for content creators, marketers, and data scientists alike.

## üîç Key Features

* **YouTube Video Metadata Extraction:** Automatically pulls video title, channel info, view count, likes, comments, and subscriber count.
* **Bulk Comment Download:** Fetches all available top-level comments using efficient pagination.
* **Sentiment Classification:** Classifies comments into positive, neutral, or negative using TextBlob‚Äôs polarity analysis.
* **Emoji Sentiment Detection:** Parses and quantifies emoji-based emotional signals embedded in comments.
* **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifies mentions of people in comments leveraging spaCy‚Äôs NLP pipeline.
* **Word Clouds:** Visualizes frequent terms for positive and negative comment clusters.
* **Custom Engagement Score:** A multi-factor, normalized metric incorporating sentiment, emoji impact, subscriber scale, and comment quality.
* **CSV Export:** Easily export analyzed data for further exploration or reporting.

## üìà Engagement Score ‚Äî A Next-Level Metric

Traditional engagement metrics often overlook the nuanced emotional tone and qualitative depth of audience interaction. This project‚Äôs engagement score innovates by integrating:

* Positive comment ratio weighted by sentiment polarity.
* Emoji sentiment intensity.
* Comment length and likes per comment as proxies for comment quality.
* Normalized subscriber interaction using logarithmic scaling.
* Classic metrics like likes-to-views and comments-to-views ratios.

The result? A rich, dynamic measure of audience engagement that captures both volume and vibe.
